# INTRODUCTION TO ECOLOGICAL REMOTE SENSING IN R

# Libraries needed:
# raster
# rgdal
# ncdf4
# RStoolbox
# ggplot2
# patchwork
# rasterdiv
# viridis

# How to install them, e.g. just type the following command in the R console:

install.packages("raster")

# then choose the CRAN, i.e. the city from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (any of them is ok!)

# To check if the package is in, simply type:

library(raster)

# If nothing happens, that's ok! If you receive an error, write to:
# Elisa Thouverai <elisa.thouverai2@unibo.it>
